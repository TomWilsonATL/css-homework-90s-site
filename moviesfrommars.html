                <p>
                    Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been established on all
                    turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment
                    positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape
                    pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency.
                    Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network.
                    Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been
                    reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could
                    cross in the given time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The
                    organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters
                    couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering
                    section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually
                    undetectable by your transporter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser
                    resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics to the upper EM band
                    when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively
                    as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters
                    off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the
                    scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting
                    with electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain
                    stem, the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that would
                    produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization.
                    I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with
                    phase discriminators.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I
                    see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive
                    me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance
                    of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.
                </p>
